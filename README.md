# **Explainable AI Part 1: Data Preparation and Machine Learning**

## Overview

Loan default prediction is a critical application in the financial industry, where lenders and institutions aim to assess the risk associated with providing loans to individuals or businesses. The goal is to identify potential borrowers more likely to default on their loans, allowing lenders to make informed decisions and mitigate financial risks.

 In the context of loan default prediction, machine learning models have shown
 promising results in accurately predicting whether a borrower will default on a loan.
 These models leverage historical data, such as past loan performance, financial history,
 employment details, and other relevant factors, to predict the likelihood of future loan
 defaults.
